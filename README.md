# Overview

## In this repository, we explore various aspects of managing and analyzing transportation-related data using MongoDB. We delve into collection maintenance operations, including updating multiple documents simultaneously (`updateMany`). Additionally, we leverage MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework to perform advanced data analysis tasks such as projecting specific fields (`$project`), performing lookups across collections (`$lookup`), unwinding arrays (`$unwind`), and skipping documents (`$skip`).

## We cover essential fields for collections such as `drivers`, `maintenance`, `orders`, `routes`, and `vehicles`, focusing on key attributes relevant to transportation systems. Each collection is carefully examined, considering the specific data elements required for effective management and analysis.

## Furthermore, we provide guidance on creating a comprehensive README.md file for GitHub repositories, ensuring clear documentation and communication with users.

## By following along with the topics covered in this repository, users can gain insights into managing transportation data efficiently using MongoDB, as well as effectively communicating project details through README files.


# Topics Covered

- `vehicles`: vehicle_id, make, model, year, color, mileage

### Operations
- `updateMany` for collection maintenance

### Aggregations
